        I've taken to reach this point of my software development career. It
        should also include a circular image of me. I am thinking the image
        should be on the left or right side with the text information on
        the other side.-->

        three projects on each row. If there are more than three projects,
        it should flow down to the next row. If the user resizes the screen,
        the grid rows should change to reflect that. The user can only shrink
        the screen up to a certain degree. The min width of the screen will be
        the width of one box. This section will also contain any relevant
        skills that I have acquired as a result of my experiences-->
